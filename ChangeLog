	* At long last, added the ChangeLog file

	* pycrash/pycrash.py: full transition to new-style classes 
	  (class PyCrash): now PyCrash inherits from "object" base class

	* pycrash/stackframe.py: full transition to new-style classes 
	  (class StackFrame): now StackFrame inherits from "object" base class

	* pycrash/exctb.py: full transition to new-style classes 
	  (class ExceptionTraceBack): now ExceptionTraceBack inherits from "object" base class

	* pycrash/pycrash.py: Now all methods (except user-defined actions) make assertion on
						  self.__initialized attribute 

	* pycrash/pycrash.py: added check for Python version 
	  (class PyCrash.__init__): added code to check if user is using the right version of

      (class PyCrash): added attribute __numberOfExceptions to count the number of uncaught

	  (onExceptionRaised): new user-defined action: onExceptionRaised is called each time an
						   uncaught exception is raised
	  (getNumberOfRaisedExceptions): new method used to return the number of uncaught raised
									 exceptions

	* pycrash/stackframe.py: added supprto to new-style classes
	  (class StackFrame): change to toXML() method to fully support new-style classes
	  (toXML): added subfunction getVarType() which abstract all operations required to 
			   fetch variable tyle and store it correctly in crash dump
	  (toXML): added subfunction isInstance() which check if a given veriable is an onject 
			   instance
