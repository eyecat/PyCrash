2004-08-21  Carmine I.D. Noviello  <cnoviello@pycrash.org>
	* pycrash/pycrash.py: fixed a bug about the _uname() function which affected the Win32 platform
	* pycrash/utils/Html.py: fixed a bug in the getOsInfo() method which affected the Win32 platform 
	* pycrash/utils/__init__.py: added a try..except block to the "from Encrypt import *", because it could
								 raise an exception if pycrypt lib is not installed
	* pycrash/stackframe.py: fixed a bug which affected the toXML() method when the attrKeys list was empty

2004-04-25  Carmine I.D. Noviello  <cnoviello@pycrash.org>
	* pycrash/utils/Html.py: added this file that contains the new HTMLPyCrash class (and all related
							 classes) used to generate dumps in HTML format
	* utils/: added the new file 'pycrash2html.py' used to convert a PyCrash file from XML to HTML

2004-04-24  Carmine I.D. Noviello  <cnoviello@pycrash.org>
	* pycrash/stackframe.py: added a bug fix
	  (class StackFrame.toXML): for some strange reason the instuction "delete attrKeys[0]", which
								skip dumping of the first object attribute to avoid redundant info,
								was disappeared. Now, this bug has been fixed.

	* pycrash/pycrash.py: added two new methods: enable() and disable()
	  (class PyCrash.__init__): now, by default, PyCrash doesn't enable automatically exception tracing.
								User must call the enable() method to enable it, and can use the disable()
								method to stop tracing in every moment. So, the hooking code has been
								moved from __init__() to enable() method.

2004-04-18  Carmine I.D. Noviello  <cnoviello@pycrash.org>
	* pycrash/pycrash.py: added the new method forceDump()
	  (class PyCrash): added the new method forceDump() to force the creation of the
					   crash dump, if an exception is raised.

	* pycrash/pycrash.py: added check for invalid exception traceback info
	  (__exceptHook): now the method __exceptHook checks if the exception traceback
									data is not 'None'

2004-04-17  Carmine I.D. Noviello  <cnoviello@pycrash.org>
	* pycrash/utils/Encrypt.py: now the getEncryptedCrashDump() method is deprecated. Its code has been
							 	moved to the getCrashDump() method
	  (class EncryptedPyCrash): overrided the getCrashDump() method, to give more polymorphic fashion
								to the class
	  (getEncryptedCrashDump):  this method is deprecated and its code has been moved to getCrashDump()
								method

2004-03-01  Carmine I.D. Noviello  <cnoviello@pycrash.org>
	* test/: added the file test-encrypted.py wich tests the new utils.Encrypt.py module

2004-02-28	Carmine I.D. Noviello  <cnoviello@pycrash.org>
	* pycrash/utils: added this sub-dir that must contain all PyCrash related utilities

	* pycrash/utils/Encrypt.py: added this file which contains the new EncryptedPyCrash class (and all
						  		related classes) used to encrypt crash dumps
	
	* utils/: added this subdir which contains 'keygen.py' and 'decrypt.py' used to generate
			  a public/private key pair and decrypt encrypted crash dumps

2004-02-27	Carmine I.D. Noviello  <cnoviello@pycrash.org>
	
	* At long last, added the ChangeLog file

	* pycrash/pycrash.py: full transition to new-style classes 
	  (class PyCrash): now PyCrash inherits from "object" base class

	* pycrash/stackframe.py: full transition to new-style classes 
	  (class StackFrame): now StackFrame inherits from "object" base class

	* pycrash/exctb.py: full transition to new-style classes 
	  (class ExceptionTraceBack): now ExceptionTraceBack inherits from "object" base class

	* pycrash/pycrash.py: Now all methods (except user-defined actions) make assertion on
						  self.__initialized attribute 

	* pycrash/pycrash.py: added check for Python version 
	  (class PyCrash.__init__): added code to check if user is using the right version of 
								Python (2.3 or later). If no, PyCrash simply doesn't set any
								hooks, in order to avoid abnormal terminations of the program
	
	* pycrash/pycrash.py: added support to onExceptionRaised() method
      (class PyCrash): added attribute __numberOfExceptions to count the number of uncaught 
					   raised exceptions
	  (__exceptHook): changed to call onExceptionRaised() appropriately
	  (onExceptionRaised): new user-defined action: onExceptionRaised is called each time an
						   uncaught exception is raised
	  (getNumberOfRaisedExceptions): new method used to return the number of uncaught raised
									 exceptions

	* pycrash/stackframe.py: added supprto to new-style classes
	  (class StackFrame): change to toXML() method to fully support new-style classes
	  (toXML): added subfunction getVarType() which abstract all operations required to 
			   fetch variable tyle and store it correctly in crash dump
	  (toXML): added subfunction isInstance() which check if a given veriable is an onject 
			   instance 
	  (getVarType): some change to the regular expression
